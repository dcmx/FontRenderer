USAGE
    fontrenderer [options] fontfile [input [output]]

The font file can be any file, that can be read and parsed by the FreeType 2
library. Note, that the font file must define a valid outline and thus a pixel
based font map cannot be specified.

Options:
    -h 
    --help            shows a list of command line options

    -v 
    --version         print version info and exit

    -l height
    --line-height     set line height
                      The line height is set as a number in floating point
                      representation relative to the character height extracted
                      from the font face.
                      A value of 1.0 represents the default line height.

    -w width
    --letter-spacing  set letter spacing
                      The letter spacing is set as a number in floating point
                      representation relative to the character width extracted
                      from the font face.
                      A value of 1.0 represents the default letter spacing.

    -s samples
    --sample-rate     set sample rate for Bézier curves
                      Sets the number of samples points to at least the given
                      integer value per 1.0 units Bézier curve length. A
                      minimum of 1 sampled point will be used.
    -u 
    --no-scale        do not scale to unit square
                      Disable scaling of the resulting data to the unit square.

Note, that the simplicity of the output is neither guaranteed nor checked.
